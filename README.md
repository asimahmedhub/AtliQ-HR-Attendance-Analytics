# 📊 AtliQ HR Attendance Analytics  
### Python-Based Attendance Insights (Apr–Jun 2022)

This project analyzes **3 months of employee attendance data** for **AtliQ Technologies**, focusing on:

- Attendance patterns  
- WFH vs WFO trends  
- Sick leave behavior  
- Early retention-risk signals  

The analysis was performed entirely in **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** to demonstrate end-to-end data preparation, cleaning, KPI generation, and visualization skills.
